    <h1>HTTP Response Status Codes</h1>
    <p>Reference sheet for the most common status codes defined by the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 specifications.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>How to read status codes</h2>
      <p>
        Each response begins with a three digit status code. The first digit identifies the class of response (informational, success, redirection, client error, or server error). The final two digits provide the specific semantics defined by the HTTP specifications or related extensions.
